  Question 1: Website creation
I created a personal graphics design portfolio website using only HTML. The website contains the following section:
.A homepage with an introduction about the me
.Home section
.About section
.Services section
.Portfolio section
.Contact section
.A footer
The purpose of the website is to showcase my background, skills and projects in a clean and organized way.
I used:
. More than 25 HTML elements such as <html>, <head>, <header>, <body>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, <h1>-<h3>, <p>, <img>, <input>, etc.
. More than 15 HTML attributes such as href, src, alt, class, id, type, name, placeholder, target, width, height, title, etc.
. Proper semantic HTML structure to organize content clearly.

  Question 2: HTML Elements
 1.  . <form>- It required careful structuring to make sure inputs were properly connected
     . <section> I needed to understand how to divide content logically.
     . <nav>- Organizing navigation links clearly was a bit tricky at first
     . 
     . 
  They were challenging because i had to understand their purpose and how they relate to other elements.
 2. I used semantic elements to give meaning to my content:
     . <header> for the top section containing my website`s name and navigation
     . <section> to divide different parts like About, Skills, and Projects.
     . <nav> for menu links.
     . <article> for individual project descriptions.
     . <footer> for contact details and copyright.
  This made the wedsite more structured and easier to understand.
 3. The <section> element was the most useful because it helped me divide the website into clear and organized parts. It made the structure clean and easy to follow and understand.

  Question 3: HTML Attrributes
 1. The three most essential attributes which without them the website would not funtion properly were:
    . href- used in links to navigate between sections and page.
    . src- Used to display images
    . type- used in form inputes to define whether it is text, email or submit.
 2. I used id for unique sections like id="about" or id="contact" so navigation links could jump directly to them
    I used class to group similar elements such as multiple project cards or form inputes
    So id was for unique identification, and class was for grouping elements.
 3. the placeholder attribute improved user experience the most because it gives users guidance on what to type. This made the contact form easier and clearer to use.
   
   Question 4: Developement Process
  1. Before coding, I sketched the layout on paper. I decided which sections I neeeded and how they would be arranged. Then I created a simple outline of the HTML structure before adding content.
  2. I frequently opened the file in the browser after making chnges. I checked for:
     . Missing closing tags 
     . Incorrect nesting
     . Broken links
     . images not displaying
    If something didn`t work I carefully reviewed the code line by line.
  3. . Structuring the page properly using semantic elements.
     . Making sure all tags were correctly closed.
     . Organizing content clearly without CSS.
   
    Question 5: Git and GitHub Implementation
  1. I used the following Git commands:
     . git init
     . git add
     . git commit -m "initial commit"
     . git remote add origin
     . git push -u origin main
     . git status
  2. I made multiple commit after completing each section, such as:
     . Added homepage structure
     . created contact form
     . Added project sectin 
     . Updated README file
  3. .It tracks changes
     . it allowws you to fix mistake
     . It helps in collaboration

    Question 6: Code Quality & Best Practices
  1.  . checked that all tags were properly opened and closed
      . used proper identification 
      . Tested the website in the browser
      . Ensured semantic structure was correct
  2.  . used sematic HTML elements
      . kept code properly indented
      . used meaningful element names 
  3. If i had more time, I would:
      . Add CSS for better styling 
      . make the design responsive
      . Add animation
      . Improve accesibility features
